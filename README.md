# EARLY DEVELOPMENT QUALITY STUFF

This is an effort to write a new Haxe plugin for Sublime Text in pure haxe using the new Python target.
Really nothing to see here yet. I just want to give some testing to the new target as well as see if it's
suitable for writing real software, such as ST plugin.

If you want a good and stable Haxe plugin, please look here: https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime-bundle
I use it everyday and it's great, also I contribute there when I discover anything while developing this
plugin.
